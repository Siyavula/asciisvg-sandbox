This is a modified version of the ASCIIsvg editor from

  http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/svg/asciisvgeditor.html

New features:

 * auto-update figure on key-up (can be disabled and a manual update
   button is still available, as before);

 * suppression of pop-up error box -- instead errors are shown in a
   <textarea> element (so that we can type and auto-update without
   pop-ups).

Open the ascii-sandbox.html file in your favorite web browser to start
using the editor.
